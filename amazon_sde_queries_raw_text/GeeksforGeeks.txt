Amazon SDE sheet is the collection of the most important topics or the most frequently asked question in Amazon Software Development Engineer Interviews. Here we have collected all the interview questions and answers to land a job on Amazon
To get employed by Amazon is a dream for many. One must have clear
Data Structure
concepts
good communication skills
, and
analytical thinking
and should be able to solve real-world problems to crack top companies like Amazon. Steps to follow to get a chance at Amazon are:
Online Application
Online test:
(60 mins) 2 coding questions of medium difficulty level. The Amazon online test (20 questions) is based on OOPs, DBMS, operating systems, data structures, and algorithms.
Technical Interview 1:
Project discussions, coding questions based on DS algorithms, and quizzes. It basically tests real-world problem-solving skills.
Technical Interview 2:
Questions of relatively higher difficulty level (mostly DS and algorithms-based)
Bar raiser round:
Behavioral questions and project discussions. Some technical questions are followed by an assessment of leadership quality and cultural fit.
For one to land a job at Amazon, he/she must have clear concepts of DSA and good practice of questions on sorting, array, string, Linked List, searching, sorting, stack, queue, tree, graph recursion backtracking dynamic programming, etc. Here through this Amazon SDE sheet, we are providing most of the coding questions which frequently pop up in amazon interviews topic-wise. This collection of interview questions will help you prepare better for your interview.
Computer Fundamentals
There are three focused computer subjects, on the basis of those subjects MCQs will be there, we have designed top MCQs for that, so you can easily test your knowledge on those subjects.

Recursion and Backtracking
Recursion
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
Backtracking
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

After qualifying the Online test you have to face 2 technical interviews, where they asked about Data Structure, algorithms, and different kinds of puzzles. Technical rounds are face-to-face algorithmic rounds in which candidates are presented with 2-4 questions, all from data structures. The most commonly asked DSs are the matrix, binary tree, BST, and Linked list. The second technical round is more difficult and more questions from Trees, BST, and Graph are asked. One should have a clear knowledge of tree-based recursion, and the standard questions based on it are a must.
P.S:
After solving all the problems mentioned above you can answer the questions which will be asked in these rounds.
Puzzles
Puzzles are one of the ways to check your problem-solving skills. These are tricky questions that let you think logically. Amazon will test your problem-solving skills through the puzzles as well. Try to solve these
20 Puzzles Commonly Asked During SDE Interviews
Project Discussion
Thoroughly revise all the work you have done till now in your projects. The grilling about projects can sometimes be very deep. Mention only those topics where you think you are fine to be grilled upon. If you don't have any project they will not ask about it, but better to have some projects, it involves questions like what's new in your project if you have created a basic clone, or what's your input followed by questions based on your technology stack.
Note:
If you have a project on AWS then you have to be confident enough to provide sufficient answers of each question,

Explain four major OOP concepts in Java.\nFour major concepts related to object-oriented programmings are:\nData encapsulation:\nIt refers to combining both data and methods into a single unit called a class. Data encapsulation helps in hiding the data from an external world.\nData abstraction:\nRepresentation of essential features excluding their background details is known as data abstraction.\nInheritance:\nDeriving existing class properties into a new class is called inheritance. A newly derived class is called the subclass(child class) and the existing class(parent class) is called the base class. It is helpful for the re-usability of code.\nPolymorphism:\nPolymorphism means the ability of an object to take multiple forms. In java, compile-time polymorphism is achieved with the help of method overloading, and run-time polymorphism is achieved with the help of method overriding.\nYou can download a PDF version of Infosys Interview Questions.\nDownload PDF\nDownload PDF\nDownload PDF\nYour requested download is ready!\nClick\nhere\nto download.\n2. Can we implement multiple inheritances in Java?\nJava does not directly support multiple inheritances. But we can achieve multiple inheritances with the help of an interface. It is possible to implement multiple interfaces into our program.\n3. How method overloading is different from method overriding?\nMethod overloading\nmeans methods are having the same name, but they differ either in the number of arguments or in the type of arguments. It is done during compile time, so it is known as compile-time polymorphism.\nMethod overriding\nmeans the ability to define subclass and super-class methods with the same name as well as the same method signatures, here the subclass method will override the super-class method. It is performed during run time, so it is known as run-time polymorphism.\nLearn via our Video Courses\n4. Distinguish between classes and interfaces in Java.\nClass\nInterface\nA class is a blueprint for the creation of objects with the same configuration for properties and methods\nAn interface is a collection of properties and methods that helps to describe an object, but it does not provide implementation or initialization for them\nA class will have abstract or concrete methods\nInterface will have abstract methods only. From Java 8 onwards, it supports static as well as default methods\nDoes not support multiple inheritance.\nMultiple Inheritance is supported\nAn interface can be implemented by a class\nInterface cannot be implemented by another interface, but it is possible to extend an interface\nUsing extends keyword, a class can be inherited from another class\nInterface cannot inherit a class, but it can inherit an interface\nIt can have all types of members(public, private or, others)\nMembers are public by default, but you can use other access specifiers also for the interface members\n5. What are DDL and DML commands in SQL?\nDDL refers to\nData Definition Language\n. DDL commands are used to define database schema i.e., to create and modify the database object structure in the database. Examples are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, etc.\nDML refers to\nData Manipulation Language\n. DML commands are used to manipulate the data within the database. Examples are: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.\nAdvance your career with\nMock Assessments\nRefine your coding skills with Mock Assessments\nReal-world coding challenges for top company interviews\nReal-world coding challenges for top companies\nReal-Life Problems\nDetailed reports\nAttempt Now\n6. Differentiate between TRUNCATE and DELETE commands in SQL.\nTRUNCATE\nDELETE\nIt is used to remove all records from a database table\nIt is used to delete specified records(one or more) from a database table\nIt is a Data Definition Language(DDL) command\nIt is a Data Manipulation Language(DML) command\nFaster than DELETE command\nSlower compared to TRUNCATE command\nCannot be applied for indexed views as it works only on tables\nCan be applied for indexed views\n7. Why indexing in SQL is useful ?\nA SQL index is a quick lookup table that helps to find records that are frequently searched by a user. An index is fast, small, and optimized for quick look-ups. It is useful for establishing a connection between the relational tables, searching large tables, and fast retrieval of data from a database.\n8. Differentiate between DDL and DML commands in SQL.\nDDL(Data Definition Language)\nDML(Data Manipulation Language)\nDDL is used to define database schema and also to define some constraints\nDML is used to manipulate the data within the database\nDoes not have further classification\nClassified into procedural and non-procedural DML\nDDL statements do not use WHERE clause\nDML statements use WHERE clause\nExamples for DDL statements are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, COMMENT, and RENAME\nExamples for DML statements are INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE\n9. What is the left outer join and the right outer join in SQL?\nLeft outer join:\nIt returns an entire set of records from the left table along with the matched records from the right table.\nRight outer join:\nIt returns an entire set of records from the right table along with the matched records from the left table.\n10. What is stored procedure?\nA stored procedure is a logical unit for a group of statements and is available for the applications that access an RDBMS(Relational Database Management System). These are stored in the database data dictionary. It can be used for data validation or access-control mechanisms.\n11. Explain pointers in C++.\nA variable that holds the address of another variable of the same data type can be called a pointer. Pointers can be created for any data type or user-defined datatypes like class, structure, etc. It allows variable passing by references using the address. For example:\nint\nx =\nint\n*ptr = &x; cout << ptr;\nHere,\nptr\nwill store the address of\n. That means the address of\nis the\nptr\nvalue.\nUsing\n*ptr\n, we can obtain the value stored in the address referenced by ptr(i.e., 25).\n*ptr\nis known as dereference operator.\nUses of pointers:\nTo point a variable present inside the memory.\nTo store addresses of dynamically allocated memory blocks.\n12. What is meant by a null pointer?\nThe pointer that does not point to any memory location is called the null pointer. It implies the pointer is empty and it is not pointing to anywhere within the memory.\nExample:\nint *pointer=NULL;\nNull pointers can be used for initializing the memory location address with the pointer of the same data type.\nExample:\nint *pointer= (int*)NULL;\n13. What is SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)?\nSDLC is an end-to-end process that defines the software development flow starting from the requirements stage to the maintenance and support stage. The SDLC stages are requirements analysis, planning, definition, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and support.\n14. What are the disadvantages of the Waterfall model?\nWorking software is produced only at the end of the life cycle\nNot suitable for complex as well as object-oriented projects.\nDifficult to measure progress within each stage\nNot recommended for the projects where requirements are frequent that may lead to a high risk of changing. So, this model is having a high amount of risk and uncertainty.\nIt is difficult to identify any business or technological bottleneck or challenges early because integration is done at the end.\n15. Explain about Agile model.\nAgile is a software development model that has an iterative approach for software development that helps teams to deliver value to their customers faster, with greater quality, with lesser errors, greater ability to respond to change.\nAn agile team delivers a product in small increments instead of a “big bang” launch. Requirements, plans, and result evaluation is continuously done, so teams have a natural mechanism for a quick response to change.\nScrum and Kanban are the most frequently used Agile methodologies.\n16. What is DLL and EXE file extension?\nEXE\nfile extension is used for executable files, it recognizes the file as a program. It runs independently. An EXE creates separate memory and process space for it.\nDLL\nstands for a dynamic link library that has functions and procedures used by other applications. This DLL can be reused by multiple applications. It will share the same memory and process space of the calling application.\n17. What is a frame in HTML?\nHTML Frames are useful for dividing browser windows into many parts where each section is able to load an HTML document separately. A frame collection in the browser window is called a frameset.\nIt permits authors to present HTML documents in multiple views, which might be subwindows or independent windows. Multiple views provide help to keep specific information visible, while other views are replaced or scrollable.\n18. Differentiate between white box and black box testing.\nWhite box testing\nBlack box testing\nThe tester will have complete knowledge about the internal working of the application.\nIt is not necessary to know the internal working of the application.\nIt is done by developers and testers(QA).\nIt is done by the end-user and also by developers and testers.\nIt is more time-consuming and exhaustive.\nIt is less time-consuming and exhaustive.\nHere, a tester will design test data and test cases.\nTesting is done based on an external or end-user perspective.\nWhite box testing is also called an open box, glass, structural testing, clear box, or code-based testing.\nBlack box testing is also called closed box, functional, data-driven testing.\n19. Explain different levels of programming languages.\nThe various programming language levels are given below:\nLow-level Language:\nLanguage which is directly understood by the machine is known as the low-level language (binary language or machine language). It is difficult for a human being to directly read and do coding in this language.\nAssembly level language:\nThis language will make use of mnemonics, which minimizes the program complexity. It is quite similar to the computer understandable machine code, but it uses words in place of numbers.\nMiddle-level Language:\nIt interacts with the abstraction layer of a computer and binds the gap between high-level and machine-level language. For example, programming languages like\nC and C++\nHigh-level language:\nThis is the highest level of the programming language in the technology, which has strong abstraction from the computer hardware details. That means this kind of programming language does not require hardware knowledge about computers. This programming language is simple to learn by human beings as it is in the human-understandable form. For example, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, etc.\n20. Write a C++ program to check whether a number is palindrome or not.\n/* A palindrome number is a number that remains same after reversing the digits. */\ninclude\n<iostream.h>\ninclude\n<conio.h>\nvoid\nmain\nint\nnum, n, rem, rev=\nclrscr\n(); cout<<\n\"Enter a number:\"\n; cin>>num; n=num;\n//Used for comparision after reversal of a number\nwhile\n(num>\n) {\n/* In this block, we retrieve each digit from a given number and will get the reversed number at the end stored at rev variable. */\nrem=num%\n; rev=(rev*\n)+rem; num=num/\n; }\n(n==rev)\n//Comparing given number with reversed number\ncout<<n<<\n\" is a palindrome.\"\nelse\ncout<<n<<\n\" is not a palindrome.\"\ngetch\n(); }\nConclusion:\nWe hope that you found this article very informative and useful for your preparations for the Infosys interview process.
